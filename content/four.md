I've started on a fun little art project based losely off of [noisebridge's Flaschen Taschen](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Flaschen_Taschen) and [c-base's Mate-Light](https://matelight.rocks).

My twist on the project is that it will be an ambient light that reacts to traffic on the local network (and maybe even the wide area network).

Parts list so far:
- ESP32-C3
