This post is going to be part of an ongoing series documenting my experiences within the Nix ecosystem.

In this post I'm documenting installing Nix itself onto my secondhand MacBook. 
<!-- more -->

I used the [nix-installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer). Installation was straightforward, even after testing the [default installation](https://nixos.org/download#nix-install-macos) of Nix on this device, removing that, and leaving lots of junk from the previous install laying around, the `nix-installer` caught all issues and provided clear instructions within its error messages on how to fix them. (after some mucking with my `/etc/fstab`, `sudo`-ing some random commands, and two reboots, I was up and running with a fresh and healthy installation of Nix.) I _really_ appreciate tools that share how to fix the errors they spit out, instead of having to immediately jump to my preferred search engine.

Nix is installed, _now what_?

Good question! I think the whole point of this is declaratively and reproducibly building stuff, so the proper way to start would probably be cracking open a file and writing some Nix? I'm likely going to create a separate post documenting using Nix to do things. For now I think I would like to leave off with just some resources I've referenced while dipping my toes into Nix.

Places to ask questions:
* The NixOS Matrix community, is a huge, fast moving, set of well defined special interest channels. - https://matrix.to/#/#community:nixos.org
* The NixOS Discourse forum, users treat this as a place to document their own projects, as well as ask basic questions. It is also where official announcements can be found. -  https://discourse.nixos.org/

General beginner resources:
* https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/
* https://nixos.wiki/
* https://nix.dev/
* https://zero-to-nix.com/

Tools that I've found to be particularly useful for looking up documentation (I prefer html docs vs a man page.)
* https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/unstable/options - nifty for `ctrl+f`-ing your way around.
* https://search.nixos.org/options - same as above, much faster.
* https://search.nixos.org/packages - when you want to quickly find if a package exists, and where it's nix definition lives.
